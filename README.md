Generating Behavior Features for Cold-Start Spam Review Detection

The realization of the model in the paper.


1）review_shuffle_w2v_c1w8-i20h0n5s100.txt  is a pre training model for text information trained by word2vec.

2) trainEmb are indexs of all examples while train、test are indexs of examples with labels.

3）bf_embedding are six RBFs of users'.

4）rd_embedding/time_embbding are EAFs of users'.

5）textConv are text features trained by textcnn. 

3/4/5 only give an example.

In pinjie, there is the final result of spliced RBFs.
